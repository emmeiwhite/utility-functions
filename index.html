    <h1>Time to look back from where we had started this Journey</h1>
    <p>Great struggles have been made in the past for this. And now I don't see any real reason to packup and stop the Journey.</p>

    <h2>Faith and Health are two great blessings</h2>
    <p>Never give up no matter what state you are in. You already know how capable you are and how much you can achieve.</p>

    <h2>Stay steadfast and make you life large.</h2>
    <p>Be brave as you always have been. Don't get upset neither overwhelmed.</p>
